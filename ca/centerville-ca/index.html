            <h3>Centerville, CA Insights: Population,
                 Influence, and Service Areas</h3>
            <p>In 1864, in an election to determine the Alpine County seat, Markleeville received the most votes, beating out Centerville and two other competing towns. Fire destroyed the home of the town's butcher—located at the corner of Montgomery and Jackson streets—in 1872, and 'the rest of the town soon faded away'. Little remains of the original settlement. A plaque documenting the history of Centerville was installed in 2013 by E Clampus Vitus, a fraternal organization. The site is now occupied by the Centerville Flat campground.</p>
